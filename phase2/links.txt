Linux From Scratch: Entropy and random number generators in Linux

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/entropy.txt

Details several applications and libraries that can add entropy and can use the
existing entropy more efficiently.  Also contains a good overview of entropy
and which types of applications should use which types of entropy.

Kernel Mailing List: Appropriate sources of entropy

http://lwn.net/Articles/283103/

Describes a little bit about /dev/random and /dev/urandom, in addition to
discussing some of the sources of entropy used to populate these devices.

Entropy Broker

http://www.vanheusden.com/entropybroker/

A utility to add entropy to the Linux entropy tool by sampling compatible audio
and video devices.  Uses a client/server architecture, making it ideal for
distributing random values to real or virtual devices.

Hardware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion (HAVEGE)

http://www.irisa.fr/caps/projects/hipsor/

Uses the internal state of the OS to generate a high level of entropy.

RFC 1750: Randomness Recommendations for Security

http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc1750.txt.pdf

(R)equest (F)or (C)omments 1750, which details potential sources of entropy.
The Linux random drivers (in the kernel source, in drivers/char/random.c)
specifically mention this document as a basis for the implementation of
/dev/random and /dev/urandom.

Stack Overflow: What is a Good Sources of Entropy are Available on a Smart Phone?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4504654/what-good-source-of-entropy-are-available-on-a-smart-phone

Top comment describes how hashing an image from the camera (even a pitch black image) 
is the best method. Apparently CCDs are excellent sources for entropy.

Hack-a-Day: Is Entropy Slowing Down Your Android Device?

http://hackaday.com/2013/01/04/is-entropy-slowing-down-your-android-device/

I mainly put htis here for the LOLs. Serously, how popular is this technique 
and why does it exist?!

The Sources of Randomness in Mobile Devices

http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/RNG_nordsec07_cameraReady.pdf

Identifies and analyzes various sources of TRNG on mobile platforms. Hopefully 
we can pick this apart and find some unique to our platform. Or possibly twist 
it to a more practical/applied method.

Accelerometers and Randomness: Perfect Together

https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jvoris/papers/wisec_11.pdf

If we choose the accelerometer as a source, this may be useful.
