%% Risks and Unknowns
For any project, it is important to understand that there are risks and unknowns
that will need to be understood and mitigated during the course of the project. 

One unknown that is central to this project is the entropy of the
accelerometer.  Although we believe, based on the findings in \cite{voris} that
accelerometers are good sources of entropy, it is possible that the
accelerometer on the Dragonboard violates some assumption given or that
technology has changed such that modern accelerometers are no longer good
sources of entropy. In this case, it would invalidate the remaining work for the
project.
