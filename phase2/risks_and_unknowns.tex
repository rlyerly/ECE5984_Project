%% Risks and Unknowns
For any project, it is important to understand that there are risks and unknowns
that will need to be understood and mitigated during the course of the project. 

One unknown that is central to this project is the entropy of the accelerometer.
Although we believe, based on the findings in \cite{voris} that accelerometers
are good sources of entropy, it is possible that the accelerometer on the
Dragonboard violates some assumption given or that technology has changed such
that modern accelerometers are no longer good sources of entropy. This can be
tested using several randomness tests, such as DIEBOLD and the NIST Entropy
tests, which will be essential to do before moving on with any sort of analysis.
These tests will show if the sensor data appears to have good entropy or not.
In the case that it does not, it would invalidate the remaining work for the
project.
