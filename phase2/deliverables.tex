% Deliverables

At the culmination of this project, the deliverables will include a detailed
report, the daemon source, post processing source, and any scripts used in
development. The report will include an analysis comparing the results with the
stock solution in terms of entropy, speed, and power. The results will be
presented, summarizing the findings of the report. 

This work will show that the potential exists to use common peripherals on
mobile devices to supply random bits to fill the entropy pool to feed the RNG.
This will be beneficial to developers who need to ensure a consistent stream of
cryptographically high-quality random numbers. The end-user may not typically be
aware of the presence of the RNG on their system, they do notice slow downs as a
result of encryption application sessions waiting for adequate entropy to be
secure. The proposed solution will allow application developers to
provide those applications with constant streams of high entropy bits preventing
these stalls from ever occurring, even on low end hardware that would not have a
hardware random number generator included.
