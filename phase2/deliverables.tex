% Deliverables

The deliverables of this project will include a detailed report, the 
daemon source, post processing source, and any scripts used in 
development.  Additionally, the results will be presented, summarizing 
the findings in the report.  

The results of this work should show that the potential exists to use 
common peripherals on mobile devices to help fill the entropy pool of 
the RNG.  This will be beneficial to devlopers who want to ensure a 
consistent stream of high-quality random numbers.  Even thought the 
end-user of these devices may not be aware of the RNG, they will notice 
slow downs in encrypted application sessions.  The proposed solution 
should reduce the chances of end-users experiencing slow downs when 
concurrent encrypted sessions require random numbers quickly.
