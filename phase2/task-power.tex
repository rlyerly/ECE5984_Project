% Power Measurements

Efficient generation of random numbers, with high entropy, is ensential 
for mobile devices.  Power must always be used carefully as to not drain 
the battery too quickly.  Any peripheral device, such as an 
accelerometer, will use more power when it is collecting data.  The 
APQ8060 Dragonboard uses a Kionix KXSD9-1026 accelerometer which draws 
typically 0.3 \mu Amps while in standby \cite{Kionix}.  However, full 
operating power draws more than 200 \mu Amps.  Running the accelerometer 
for any length of time, at a high sampling rate, may draw more power 
than other sources of entropy.  For this task of the project, the 
implemented daemon will be run while sampling the current draw of the 
whole system.  The result will show if the proposed solution has a 
significant increase in power usage over the stock RNG.
