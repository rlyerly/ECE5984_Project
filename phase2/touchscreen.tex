%touchscreen

Additional research has also explored the use of a mobile device's touch 
screen as a source for random number generation.  One particular paper 
\cite{montville2003random}, discussed the use of an input application presented 
to the end-user where they would move their finger to generate 
coordinates.  These coordinates were filtered to only use the lower 
eight bits of each value and produced good entropy.  However, this 
solution is only good for generating random data infrequently.  An 
example use might be generating a password or key that doesn't change
frequently.  For encrypting session data, such as TLS, it would require
more interaction from the end-user and be inconvenient.
