<<<<<<< HEAD
Efficient generation of random numbers, with high entropy, is ensential 
for mobile devices.  Power must always be used carefully as to not drain 
the battery too quickly.  Any peripheral device, such as an 
accelerometer, will use more power when it is collecting data.  The 
APQ8060 Dragonboard uses a Kionix KXSD9-1026 accelerometer which draws 
typically 0.3 \mu Amps while in standby \cite{Kionix}.  However, full 
operating power draws more than 200 \mu Amps.  Running the accelerometer 
for any length of time, at a high sampling rate, may draw more power 
than other sources of entropy.  For this task of the project, the 
implemented daemon will be run while sampling the current draw of the 
whole system.  The result will show if the proposed solution has a 
significant increase in power usage over the stock RNG.

Efficient generation of random numbers, with high entropy, is essential for
mobile devices, however power must always be used carefully as to not drain the
battery too quickly. Any peripheral device, such as an accelerometer, will use
more power when it is collecting data. The APQ8060 Dragonboard uses a Kionix
KXSD9-1026 accelerometer which draws typically 0.3 $\mu$ Amps at 2.6 Volts while
in standby \cite{Kionix}. However, full operating power draws more than 200
$\mu$ Amps. Running the accelerometer for any length of time, at a high sampling
rate, may draw more power than other sources of entropy. As a result, the
implemented daemon will be able to sense when the entropy pool is full and pause
its collection until it senses that the pool has been depleted. This should
prevent the battery from being drained excessively as a result of this method of
entropy gathering.
