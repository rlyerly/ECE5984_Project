%% Expectations

The apparent randomness of the accelerometer and gyroscope, accompanied with the
relatively low power nature of the components as well as their ubiquity on smart
phones, tends to suggest that they would be an excellent source of entropy for
mobile platforms. A solution that pulls from these sensors should be easily
deployed to several different platforms, including those that do not have the
benefit of an on board hardware random number generator. As quality random
numbers are necessary for most of the common cryptographic operations that are
necessary in today's networked world, such a system will be able to bring faster
and more secure communication to more devices.
