%touchscreen

Additional research has explored the use of a mobile device's touch 
screen as a source for random number generation.  One particular paper 
\cite{montville2003random} discussed the use of an input application presented 
to the end-user where the user would move their finger to generate 
coordinates.  These coordinates were filtered such that only the lower 
eight bits of each value were used, which produced good entropy.  However, this 
solution is only good for generating random data infrequently.  An 
example use might be generating a password or key that doesn't change
often.  For encrypting session data, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS),
this approach would require more interaction from the end-user and would be
inconvenient.
