In order to show that sampling accelerometer and gyroscope data is an effective
mechanism for randomness generation on mobile phones, a testing methodology was
developed. This testing methodology involved gathering data from mobile phones
and utilizing well regarded statistical analysis suites to determine the quality
of the results. To maintain data equivalence across testing, a single platform
was chosen for all of the tests.

\subsection{Samsung Nexus S}

The platform used for testing was the Samsung Nexus S. The Nexus S was first
released in December of 2010. It uses a Samsung Exynos 3110 System on Chip
(SoC). The Exynos 3110 is a single core ARM Cortex-A8 using the ARMv7
instruction set. In the Nexus S, the processor operates at a 1GHz clock
frequency and is paired with 512MB of main memory. The phone originally shipped
with Android 2.3 Gingerbread installed but was updated to the latest supported
build, 4.1.2 Jelly Bean.  The Nexus S has both a three-axis gyroscope and
accelerometer provided by the InvenSense MPU-6050. The MPU-6050 communicates to
the CPU via an I\textsuperscript{2}C bus operating at 400KHz. 

The Nexus S was selected because it represented both a vanilla Android mobile
phone, but also because it is an example of a widely popular mobile phone that
does not have a hardware random number generator. As such it was a good first
target for implementing an additional source of entropy for the kernel's entropy
pool. Ideally, by providing fast random number generation on a platform that
suffers from a reduced number of sources of entropy, improved cryptographic
speed as well as security could be brought to users of such devices.


%%% Background about NIST
\subsection{NIST Statistical Testing Suite}

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publishes a
statistical testing suite for the verification of random number generators.
Described in Special Publication 800-22 \cite{nist}, the \textit{Statistical
Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators for Cryptographic
Applications} comprises 15 statistical tests that analyze a source of bitstreams
for the apparent lack of entropy. The documentation does note both that some
tests are expected to fail even for good pseudorandom number generators and it
should further be noted that even a random number generator that appears to pass
these tests is not necessarily random, it just has the appearance thereof.

The NIST statistical test suite was selected for use because it provides a
rigorous testing suite that is recognized as providing quality statistical
analysis of apparently random bitstreams. This statistical test suite was used
to test the quality of potentially random data from several sources, including
unprocessed data from the sensors, random devices from the stock system, as well
as several modifications on adding data from the sensors to the kernel's entropy
pool and drawing from the randomness devices.

\subsection{Data Collection Software}

In order to test the efficacy of using accelerometer and gyroscope sampling to
feed the entropy pool, several pieces of software had to be developed to aid in
the research. The software developed is split into two distinct applications
that work together: the java application, and the entropy insertion daemon. This
model was chosen because of limitations in the security model of the Android
Operating System. Being able to add entropy to the kernel's pool is a privileged
operation to prevent attackers from poisoning the host's randomness, but Android
applications can only launch as a user process and then execute a privileged
native application, such as \textit{su}. As a result of these requirements, the
entropy insertion daemon is written as a native application that runs with 
privileged authority and the entropy collection is written as an Android
application that communicates with the entropy insertion daemon using a named
pipe.
