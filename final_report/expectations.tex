%% Expectations

From the findings of \cite{voris}, accelerometers appear to be highly random. A
high rate of sampling shows that they are fairly fast and should be able to
provide a high rate of random bits per second when they are needed.
The apparent randomness of the accelerometer and gyroscope, accompanied with the
relatively low power nature of the components as well as their ubiquity on smart
phones, tends to suggest that they would be an excellent source of entropy for
mobile platforms. 

Fortunately, most of the interfaces needed in our design are highly portable,
and as such our solution can easily be ported to several platforms. Platforms
with better components are in a better position to take advantage of the
improved speed and security that can come from including more data in the
kernel's entropy pool.  As quality random numbers are necessary for most of the
common cryptographic operations, such a system is able to bring faster
secure communication to more devices.
