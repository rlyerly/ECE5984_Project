%% Expectations

From the findings of \cite{voris}, accelerometers appear to be highly random. A
high rate of sampling shows that they are fairly fast and should be able to
provide a high rate of random bits per second when they are needed. The
specification sheet for the accelerometer found on the Dragonboard shows that it
is also efficient for power consumption.

The apparent randomness of the accelerometer and gyroscope, accompanied with the
relatively low power nature of the components as well as their ubiquity on smart
phones, tends to suggest that they would be an excellent source of entropy for
mobile platforms. A solution that pulls from these sensors should be easily
deployed to several different platforms, including those that do not have the
benefit of an on board hardware random number generator. As quality random
numbers are necessary for most of the common cryptographic operations, such a
system will be able to bring faster secure communication to more devices.
