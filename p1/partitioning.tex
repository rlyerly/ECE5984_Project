This project presented us with a large problem set that would be impossible for
any of us to do individually in the time constraints provided. This is not an
insurmountable problem because of the parallel nature of analyzing the
performance of the various algorithms. 

In order to make analyzing the various algorithms possible, we partitioned the
algorithms up between us.
